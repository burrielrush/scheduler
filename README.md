# <Busy day scheduler>
  
## This is a workday scheduler application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library. The application provides a simple calendar for scheduling tasks during the workday. The user can input their tasks or notes into each hour block of the day, and the application saves the input data to local storage so that the information persists even if the user closes or refreshes the page.

The application also uses JavaScript to update the time and date in real-time, and to apply different styles to the hour blocks based on whether the current time is in the past, present, or future. For instance, the hour blocks for past times are given a gray background, while the blocks for present times are given a red background, and future blocks are given a green background.

The application is structured using a simple HTML layout that includes a header, a container for the hour blocks, and a footer that contains the date and time. The CSS file provides the styling for the application, while the JavaScript code handles the functionality of the app, including updating the time, saving user input to local storage, and applying the appropriate styling to each hour block.

Overall, this application provides a useful tool for anyone looking to organize their workday tasks and stay on top of their schedule.
